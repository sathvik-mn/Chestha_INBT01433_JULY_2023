## Task 1 :
 	Implement a Machine Learning Model for Classification Problem

1.1 Project Overview

In this minor task 1 , the objective is to build a classification model for predicting the presence and absence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. Heart disease prediction is not only crutial but also need to be accurate. 

1.2 Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Description : 

The Heart-Disease-Dataset contains a total of 76 attributes. However, for the purpose of this project, we are focusing on a subset of 14 attributes that have been consistently used in prior experiments. These experiments, conducted by machine learning researchers, have particularly emphasized the utilization of the Cleveland database.


## Task 2 :
Implement a machine learning model for regression problem

2.1 Project Overview


In this machine learning project, we aim to develop an accurate predictive model for PM2.5 air pollution levels. PM2.5, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller, is a significant environmental pollutant with adverse health effects. By leveraging historical data encompassing meteorological and environmental attributes, we intend to build a model that can forecast PM2.5 concentrations in specific areas.

## Task 3 : Major Project
Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation for an E-Commerce Platform

3.1 Project Overview 

This project delves into the "Online Retail II" dataset, capturing transactions of a UK-based online retail business from December 2009 to December 2011. The platform specializes in selling distinctive all-occasion gift-ware, serving both individual buyers and wholesalers. The objective is to extract insights to inform business strategies by analyzing customer behavior, sales patterns, and market trends.

3.2 Data Collection and Pre-processing
